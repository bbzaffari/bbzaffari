### 🔹 [Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) - tDES](https://github.com/bbzaffari/MMIO-tripleDes-VHDL-core)

Hardware crypto module with **Triple DES core in VHDL**, exposed via **memory-mapped I/O registers** on a RISC-compatible SoC.
Implements full register binding to the RTL provided by vendors, enabling read/write operations through system calls on a lightweight **RTOS (UCX/OS)**.
Supports multiple cipher modes *(**ECB**, **CBC**, **CTR**)*.
Validated end-to-end through data encryption tests and binary inspection using `hexdump`.

## 🧠 What I Believe

> “Firmware, networks, memory and learning — it’s all part of the same reliability surface.”

🧩 I approach systems as unified layers — from bits to models.  
📐 I aim for technical rigor, clean documentation, and reusable architecture.  
🌍 I’m constantly exploring intersections between AI, embedded design, and resilient engineering.
